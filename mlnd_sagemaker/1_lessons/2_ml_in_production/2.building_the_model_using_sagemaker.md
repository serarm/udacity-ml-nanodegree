# 2. Building a model using sagemaker

1. `What is Sagemaker?`:AWS (or Amazon) SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides the ability to build, train, tune, deploy, and manage large-scale machine learning (ML) models quickly.
2. `Why to use Sagemaker`: It makes 3 sstages of ML workflow easy.Jupyter notebook helps in simplifying `explore and process data` where Sagemaker API simplify `Modeling` and `Deployment`

## The Amazon Sagemaker provides the following tools:

- Ground Truth - To label the jobs, datasets, and workforces
- Notebook - To create Jupyter notebook instances, configure the lifecycle of the notebooks, and attache Git repositories
- Training - To choose an ML algorithm, define the training jobs, and tune the hyperparameter
- Inference - To compile and configure the trained models, and endpoints for deployments
